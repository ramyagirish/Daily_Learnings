# Introduction

As a passionate learner always wanted to set a personal goal of learning something new everyday aside from learning so many tools and concepts for work related purposes. This is a simple compilation of things I learn on a day-to-day basis from programming concepts, python tools to some very deep DS, ML concepts. Happy Learning!
